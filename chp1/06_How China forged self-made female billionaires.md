Socialist egalitarianism isn’t the whole story

cross or walk in the street or road unlawfully or without regard for approaching traffic.

visage
the face
The 64-year-old boss of Gree, the world’s biggest maker of air-conditioners, is everywhere: in television ads, on billboards and, last year, in two places at once—jaywalking in the city of Ningbo while at Gree’s headquarters in Zhuhai (police cameras mistakenly captured her visage plastered on a bus).

penchant
Her steely, unglamorous image (a confessed penchant for skirts notwithstanding) inspires young women. 

mogul
China’s include Wu Yajun, a property mogul with a $10bn fortune;

echelon
If socialist egalitarianism—which encouraged, even required, women to work—were the whole story, you would expect many of them in the upper echelons of the Communist Party. 

Rosy for riveters
Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of World War II, representing the women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II, many of whom produced munitions and war supplies. These women sometimes took entirely new jobs replacing the male workers who joined the military.


erstwhile
In 2015 Zhou Qunfei, an erstwhile migrant worker who went on to found Lens Technology, maker of screens for Apple, took the title of the world’s wealthiest self-made woman.

firmament
After the government expanded college attendance in 1999, women began to prop up more than half the educational firmament: they make up 56% of graduates, though only 87 girls are born for every 100 boys (the world’s most unbalanced sex ratio).

stymied
But it may be stymied by a general slowdown in the pace of female progress, plus specific hurdles women face in the most promising avenue for today’s aspiring entrepreneurs: China’s internet sector.

misogynistic 

streak

Chinese tech, meanwhile, has displayed a misogynistic streak.

pole-dancing
Last year Human Rights Watch, an ngo, reported that Alibaba produced a video of female employees who “love tech guys”, including one pole-dancing in hotpants.

misogyny
Ms Dong faced her share of misogyny early on.

decimated
He admits that his sleep routine has “decimated my social life”, and that his partner sleeps in a different room, but says all this trouble is worth it, because it has boosted his level of “deep sleep” by as much as 157%.

backers 
In its most recent funding round, backers of Oura, the Finnish maker of the high-tech ring, included the co-founders of YouTube and Twitch, along with alumni of Facebook, Skype and Box.com.

cryotherapy
The ring’s most famous user is Jack Dorsey, the boss of Twitter, whose unusual wellness regime—which also incorporates near-infrared saunas, radiation-blocking Faraday tents, fasting and cryotherapy—prompted the New York Times this month to dub him “Gwyneth Paltrow for Silicon Valley”.
