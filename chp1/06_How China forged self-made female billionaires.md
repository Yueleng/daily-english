## [How China forged self-made female billionaires](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/18/how-china-forged-self-made-female-billionaires)

egalitarianism
Socialist egalitarianism isn’t the whole story

billboards

jaywalking
cross or walk in the street or road unlawfully or without regard for approaching traffic.

visage
the face
The 64-year-old boss of Gree, the world’s biggest maker of air-conditioners, is everywhere: in television ads, on billboards and, last year, in two places at once—jaywalking in the city of Ningbo while at Gree’s headquarters in Zhuhai (police cameras mistakenly captured her visage plastered on a bus).

steely

unglamorous

penchant
Her steely, unglamorous image (a confessed penchant for skirts notwithstanding) inspires young women. 

mogul
China’s include Wu Yajun, a property mogul with a $10bn fortune;

echelon
If socialist egalitarianism—which encouraged, even required, women to work—were the whole story, you would expect many of them in the upper echelons of the Communist Party. 

Rosy for riveters
Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of World War II, representing the women who worked in factories and shipyards during World War II, many of whom produced munitions and war supplies. These women sometimes took entirely new jobs replacing the male workers who joined the military.


erstwhile
In 2015 Zhou Qunfei, an erstwhile migrant worker who went on to found Lens Technology, maker of screens for Apple, took the title of the world’s wealthiest self-made woman.

firmament
After the government expanded college attendance in 1999, women began to prop up more than half the educational firmament: they make up 56% of graduates, though only 87 girls are born for every 100 boys (the world’s most unbalanced sex ratio).

stymied
But it may be stymied by a general slowdown in the pace of female progress, plus specific hurdles women face in the most promising avenue for today’s aspiring entrepreneurs: China’s internet sector.

misogynistic 

streak

Chinese tech, meanwhile, has displayed a misogynistic streak.

pole-dancing
Last year Human Rights Watch, an ngo, reported that Alibaba produced a video of female employees who “love tech guys”, including one pole-dancing in hotpants.

misogyny
Ms Dong faced her share of misogyny early on.

[Sleepless in Silicon Valley](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/18/sleepless-in-silicon-valley)

blackout 
First, close the blackout blinds in your bedroom.

slumber
You are now, finally, ready for slumber.

decimated
He admits that his sleep routine has “decimated my social life”, and that his partner sleeps in a different room, but says all this trouble is worth it, because it has boosted his level of “deep sleep” by as much as 157%.

backers 
In its most recent funding round, backers of Oura, the Finnish maker of the high-tech ring, included the co-founders of YouTube and Twitch, along with alumni of Facebook, Skype and Box.com.

infrared
cryotherapy
The ring’s most famous user is Jack Dorsey, the boss of Twitter, whose unusual wellness regime—which also incorporates near-infrared saunas, radiation-blocking Faraday tents, fasting and cryotherapy—prompted the New York Times this month to dub him “Gwyneth Paltrow for Silicon Valley”.

mattress-chillers
As well as electric blankets and mattress-chillers, sound machines and smart rings, there are also smart pillows, sleep-tracking watches and bracelets, intelligent sleep masks, brain-stimulating headbands, bedside sleep sensors and countless sleep-monitoring apps

household 
Big companies in the field include household names such as Apple, Bose, Nokia and Philips. 

back-ordered
After Mr Dorsey’s enthusiastic endorsement, the Oura rings are back-ordered by four to six weeks.

mania 
The mania for sleep technology makes perfect sense for the tech industry, combining as it does several existing trends.

guru
As those in the startup world like to say, channelling Peter Drucker, a management guru, “what’s measured improves.”

fastidious
This ranges from wearing the same clothes every day, Steve Jobs-style (thus avoiding wasting time deciding what to put on), to fastidious fitness routines and complicated diets.

wimp
Relentlessly pursuing productivity only while you are awake is for wimps.

hype
Never mind that a study published in 2015, by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, found that sleep-tracking devices could not accurately measure sleep, and that claims made about them were long on hype and short on solid evidence.

dodgy 
Ignore the fact that another study, published in 2017 by researchers at two medical schools in Chicago, warned of the dangers of “orthosomnia”, defined as a “perfectionistic quest for the ideal sleep in order to optimise daytime function”, as obsessive users of sleep-tech devices self-diagnose sleep disturbances based on dodgy data, or stay awake all night worrying that they are falling behind by not sleeping as efficiently as rivals.

clog
Are the streets of your city clogged with Ubers? Try an electric scooter instead.

deprivation
Seen this way, the embrace of sleep-tracking is an indictment of the whole culture: it tackles the symptoms of sleep deprivation, but not the disease.

batty
But resist the temptation to dismiss all this as batty.

bats an eyelid
Now fitness trackers (including the Apple Watch) are mainstream and nobody bats an eyelid when people share details of their morning runs on Facebook.

hail
A series of previous examples—including the use of email, the embrace of online shopping, hailing a car with an app, or renting a room in an unfamiliar city from a complete stranger—are a reminder that the seemingly crazy things that Silicon Valley types do today, everyone else may end up doing in a decade’s time. In this case, in their sleep.
