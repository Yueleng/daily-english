## [How the West got China wrong](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/03/01/how-the-west-got-china-wrong)

### autocracy

* *noun*,  government by a single person or small group that has unlimited power or authority, or the power or authority of such a person or group

### dictatorship

* *[example] Last weekend China stepped from autocracy into dictatorship.*

### let it be known

* to give information to other people, especially in an 
indirect way

### conceivably

* *[example] That was when Xi Jinping, already the world’s most powerful man, let it be known that he will change China’s constitution so that he can rule as president for as long as he chooses—and conceivably for life.*

### wield

* *verb*, to hold a weapon or tool and look as if you are going to use it.
* *[example]  Not since Mao Zedong has a Chinese leader wielded so much power so openly.*

### stake

* *[example] Western leaders believed that giving China a stake in institutions such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would bind it into the rules-based system set up after the second world war (see Briefing).*

### yearn

* *[example] They hoped that economic integration would encourage China to evolve into a market economy and that, as they grew wealthier, its people would come to yearn for democratic freedoms, rights and the rule of law.*

### rife

* *adjective*, If something unpleasant is rife, it is very common or happens a lot.
* *[example] Under the leadership of Hu Jintao, you could still picture the bet paying off. When Mr Xi took power five years ago China was rife with speculation that he would move towards constitutional rule.*

### shattered

* *[example] Today the illusion has been shattered. In reality, Mr Xi has steered politics and economics towards repression, state control and confrontation.*

### hail

* *[example] All hail, Xi Dada*

### purged

* *[example] As part of a campaign against corruption, he has purged potential rivals.*

### sweeping

* *[example] He has executed a sweeping reorganisation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), partly to ensure its loyalty to the party, and to him personally.*

### deviance

* *[example] Though people’s personal lives remain relatively free, he is creating a surveillance state to monitor discontent and deviance.*

### profess


### so long as

* *[example] China used to profess no interest in how other countries run themselves, so long as it was left alone. Increasingly, however, it holds its authoritarian system up as a rival to liberal democracy.*

### course

* *[example] Yet China is not a market economy and, on its present course, never will be. Instead, it increasingly controls business as an arm of state power.*

### subsidies

* *[example] Its “Made in China 2025” plan, for instance, sets out to use subsidies and protection to create world leaders in ten industries, including aviation, tech and energy, which together cover nearly 40% of its manufacturing.*

### blatant



### espionage

* *[example] Although China has become less blatant about industrial espionage, Western companies still complain of state-sponsored raids on their intellectual property.*

### dwarfing

* *[example] Take the Belt and Road Initiative, which promises to invest over $1tn in markets abroad, ultimately dwarfing the Marshall plan.*

### frustrate

* *[example] The initiative asks countries to accept Chinese-based dispute-resolution. Should today’s Western norms frustrate Chinese ambition, this mechanism could become an alternative.*

### grovelling

* *[example] It seeks to punish firms directly, as when Mercedes-Benz, a German carmaker, was recently obliged to issue a grovelling apology after unthinkingly quoting the Dalai Lama online.*

### clout

* *[example] As China’s economic clout grows, so could this sort of pressure.*

### islets

* *[example] As with Scarborough Shoal, China has seized and built on a number of reefs and islets.*

### resolve

* *[example] The PLA still could not defeat America in a fight, but power is about resolve as well as strength.*

### smacks

### unilateralism

* *[example] And, however much Mr Trump protests, his promise to “Make America Great Again” smacks of a retreat into unilateralism that can only strengthen China’s hand.*

### recast

* *[example] Instead Mr Trump needs to recast the range of China policy.*

### Putting up with

* *[example] Putting up with misbehaviour today in the hope that engagement will make China better tomorrow does not make sense.*

### grudgingly

### accommodates

* *[example] The longer the West grudgingly accommodates China’s abuses, the more dangerous it will be to challenge them later.*

### In every sphere

### edged

### cleaves

* *[example] In every sphere, therefore, policy needs to be harder edged, even as the West cleaves to the values it claims are universal.*

### shed light on

* *[example] To counter China’s sharp power, Western societies should seek to shed light on links between independent foundations, even student groups, and the Chinese state.*

### bolster

* *[example] It should bolster institutions that defend the order it is trying to preserve.*
