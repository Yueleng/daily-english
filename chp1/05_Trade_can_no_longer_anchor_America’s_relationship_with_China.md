## [Trade can no longer anchor America’s relationship with China](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/05/18/trade-can-no-longer-anchor-americas-relationship-with-china)

anchor
Trade can no longer anchor America’s relationship with China

motive
Since china emerged from the wreckage of Maoism 40 years ago, the profit motive has become a pillar of stability in its relations with America.

queasy
feeling worried, unhappy, or uncertain about something:
This focus on mutual self-interest involved queasy compromises.

discreet
careful not to cause embarrassment or attract too much attention, especially by keeping something secret:
Soon after troops massacred hundreds, possibly thousands, around Tiananmen Square in June 1989, President George H.W. Bush wrote discreetly to Deng Xiaoping to urge joint efforts to prevent “tragic recent events” from harming relations.

thrift
the careful use of money, especially by avoiding waste
The financial crash of 2008 revealed a dangerous co-dependency between America the importer of cheap goods and China the thrifty exporter. New terms tried to capture this symbiosis: “Chimerica”, or “the g2”.

neologisms
Rather than catchy neologisms, scholars are reaching for historical analogies.

sweep aside
Some talk of 1914, when clashing British and German ambitions swept aside deep bonds of commerce. 

Thucydides trap

incumbent
China analysts obsess over the “Thucydides trap” that supposedly dooms upstart nations to fighting incumbent powers, as the Greek historian wrote of Sparta and Athens.

lopsided
with one side bigger, higher, etc. than the other; not equally balanced.
But it was a lopsided political fight: Japan was a dependent military ally.

accountable
Western leaders had hoped that joining the global economy would make China more like the West, as a growing middle class demanded free speech and more accountable government.

populism
The crash of 2008 and spasms of Western populism emboldened Communist Party leaders, notably President Xi Jinping, to reject those norms and assert the party’s supremacy.

choke
to make someone stop breathing by pressing their throat with the hands

grave
seriously bad:
Define sensitive technologies too broadly and, in the words of Henry Paulson, a former secretary of the treasury, an “economic iron curtain” may come to divide China and America, choking flows of goods, capital, people and technology, with grave implications for the rest of the world.

prowess
great ability or skill.
China’s growing tech prowess is putting new strains on globalisation, beyond old arguments about stolen jobs.

political stake
It means that there is more at risk, more danger- the issue has taken a greater importance and could have a greater impact. A stake is the amount of money bet on the outcome of a result, like a horse race, gambling, etc, so if the stakes are higher, there's more to be won or lost.
Today’s supply chains, carrying semiconductors from China to devices in America, actually raise the political stakes.

quarantine
to put an animal or person in quarantine (a period of time during which an animal or person that might have a disease is kept away from other people or animals so that the disease cannot spread.)

foe
an enemy:
In this world, trade relations cannot be quarantined from hard questions about whether countries are partners, rivals or foes.

contention
the disagreement that results from opposing arguments.
It is the relentlessness of its methods that has turned business from a safe space to a field of contention.

proponent
Few Americans have better access to Chinese leaders than Mr Paulson, a longtime proponent of engagement.

confrontational
causing or involving angry disagreement:
Bosses do not seek a tariff war, he said, but do want a “more confrontational approach”. Businesses are getting that from the Trump administration.

occupant
a person who lives or works in a room or building:

Oval Office
The Oval Office is, since 1909, the working office space of the President of the United States, located in the West Wing of the White House, Washington, D.C.
In part, this is explained by the change in occupant of the Oval Office.

Belatedly
coming later than expected:

outpost
a place, especially a small group of buildings or a town, that represents the authority or business interests of a government or company that is far away.
Belatedly, his Pentagon chiefs grew alarmed as China turned disputed reefs in the South China Sea into military outposts. 

pandemics 
(of a disease) existing in almost all of an area or in almost all of a group of people, animals, or plants.
But ultimately Mr Obama put more weight on tackling global challenges, from climate change to pandemics to nuclear proliferation, for which he needed Chinese help.

populist
a person, especially a politician, who strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.
In part, America has become more confrontational because multinational businesses that oppose barriers to trade have lost clout in a populist age.

truce
a short interruption in a war or argument, or an agreement to stop fighting or arguing for a period of time.
A new round of export controls for sensitive technologies and still-tougher investment-screening rules loom. That process will not end with a truce in Mr Trump’s trade war.

scorn
Voters elected a might-makes-right leader who scorns alliances, who is cynical about the rule of law and universal values and who believes that national interests always come first.

quizz
to ask someone questions about something.
FBI agents have quizzed scholars visiting from Chinese state-backed think-tanks about government links, and cancelled the visas of some.

sore 
painful and uncomfortable, esp. (of a body part) because of injury or infection or (of a muscle) from being used too much:
Meanwhile, officials in Beijing see a sore loser of a superpower, bent on keeping them down.

ploy
something that is done or said in order to get an advantage, often dishonestly:
They scoff at the idea that rich, spoiled America really feels threatened, seeing a ploy to extract better terms for American firms to make money

miss
This misses how many people in Washington believe that the China threat is real and matters more than profits or free-market purity.

emphatic
done or said in a strong way and without any doubt:
A senior American official says that China “emphatically” lied when it promised Mr Obama in 2015 that state-backed actors would stop spying on America for commercial gain.

laments
to express sadness and feeling sorry about something:

frenzied
uncontrolled and excited, sometimes violent:
The official laments that, in the frenzied Washington news cycle, few noticed a Department of Justice indictment in December 2018 accusing China’s ministry of state security of ties to a long-standing campaign by the APT10 hacking group, stealing secrets from firms in aviation, space, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, maritime and other technologies.

snigger
to laugh at someone or something in a silly and often unkind way.
The pendulum risks swinging too far. Some sniggered in March when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (cfius), a government agency that screens foreign deals for security concerns, asked a Chinese internet firm to sell Grindr, a gay dating app with 3.3m daily users.

“forward presence” doctrine
Since the 1980s America has pursued a “forward presence” doctrine, meaning that its forces were confident about operating close to enemy defences. China’s growing strength confronts Pentagon planners with their hardest decision in years: to find new ways to make combat in the Western Pacific viable, or pull back and force adversaries to fight far from home.

grapple
to fight, especially in order to win something:
Now at Stanford University, he describes commanders grappling with the end of overwhelming American superiority: “There is an intense debate within the American armed forces about how to counter the PLA’s accelerating efforts to control the South China Sea.”

cut accross
to include within the scope of effect or significance
In Washington, talk of a China threat cuts across the political divide

annexe
an extra building added to a larger building:

pomp
showy, formal ceremony, esp. on public occasions.
Amid the high-ceilinged pomp of the Indian Treaty Room, the executives signed one-day non-disclosure agreements allowing them to see classified material.

afoot
happening or being planned or prepared:
Recent arrests of alleged Chinese spies reveal only a small fraction of what is afoot, Mr Rubio says.

vow
to make a determined decision or promise to do something.
Too often politicians would vow to get tough on Chinese cheating.

deputised
to act or speak for another person, especially at work.
Then these CEOs would be deputised by China to march down to the White House.

venture capitalist
A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor that provides capital to firms exhibiting high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake.


grumble
to complain about someone or something in an annoyed way:
Mr Rubio grumbles that the business plan of some Silicon Valley tech firms is to get bought up, without necessarily caring if the investors are Chinese.

remit
the area that a person or group of people in authority has responsibility for or control over:
The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act recently extended the remit of CFIUS to new areas, such as property purchases near sensitive sites.

pilot
A pilot plan, product, or system is used to test how good something is before introducing it:

mandate
to give official permission for something to happen, to order someone to do something.
A pilot scheme mandates reviews of foreign stakes in a wide array of “critical technologies”.

bipartisan
supported by or consisting of two political parties.
The staging of that October road show—a bipartisan endeavour involving Congress and the intelligence agencies, close to the White House but not inside it—is revealing.

stand apart
Mr Trump stands apart.

Discern
to see, recognize, or understand something that is not clear:
Discerning a united view of China within Team Trump is hard.

trample
to step heavily on something or someone, causing damage or injury.

nicety
a detail or small difference that is only obvious after careful thought. The fact that something is based on very slight differences
That tone is a sign of their boss’s willingness to trample diplomatic niceties.

climb down
to descend, especially by using both hands and feet. to retreat, as from an indefensible opinion or position:
He also sees political risks in any trade deal that can be branded a climb-down.

Telling
with a striking or revealing effect; significantly.
Tellingly Mr Trump’s China tariff escalation on May 10th was accompanied by defensive tweets asserting that China yearns for a “very weak” Democrat to win the 2020 election instead.

predate
to have existed or happened before another thing:

outlast
to live or exist, or to stay energetic and determined, longer than another person or thing:
Modern-day Chinese mandarins obsess over differences within the Trump administration, not realising that the hardening of the Washington mood predates and will outlast Mr Trump.

gander
Taking a proper gander

sabotage
A study commissioned by the Pentagon, “Deliver Uncompromised”, warns that insecure supply chains place America’s armed forces at “grave risk” from hacking and high-tech sabotage, for instance by the insertion of malware or components designed to fail in combat.

provenance
The study, by Mitre, a research outfit, notes that modern fighter jets may rely on 10m lines of software code, so it matters if tech firms use code of unknown provenance, as some do.

scour
to search a place or thing very carefully in order to try to find something.
Pentagon chiefs have created a new Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis whose mission includes scouring defence contracts for Chinese companies, down to third-tier suppliers.

foundry
He already sees more high-value defence contracts going to semiconductor foundries in America.

containment strategy
Containment was a United States policy using numerous strategies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to enlarge its communist sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam.
On April 29th the State Department’s director of policy planning, Kiron Skinner, told a forum hosted by New America, a Washington think-tank, that there was a need for a China strategy equivalent to George Kennan’s containment strategy for the Soviet Union.

bombshell
one that is stunning, amazing, or devastating
Not content with that bombshell, Ms Skinner ventured that China is a harder problem.

ahistoricism
Leaving aside the ahistoricism of Ms Skinner’s comments—for China’s Communists drew deeply on Marx and Lenin—they are self-defeating.

revisionist
someone who examines and tries to change existing beliefs about how events happened or what their importance or meaning is:
China is selectively revisionist, wrote Mr Feigenbaum. Rather than seeking to replace today’s international system, it upholds many of the “forms” of multilateralism while undermining “norms” from within the UN and other bodies.

The Capitol
the building in which the US Congress meets
In a break between votes, in a windowless office deep in the Capitol, Mr Coons urges Congress to try the hard work of dealing with China as it is and not as America wishes it to be.

concede
to admit, often unwillingly, that something is true:

dovish
supporting discussion or other peaceful solutions in political relationships rather than the use of force:
He does not think China is hostile to the idea of a rules-based order, but concedes that it has “behaved exceptionally badly on the world economic stage”. In today’s Washington, that is dovish talk.

lingering 
lasting a long time:

harbours 
to protect someone or something bad, especially by hiding that person or thing when the police are looking for him, her, or it:
Marriage metaphors capture the lingering admiration mixed with envy and resentment that China’s elite harbours for its global rival.

cadres
a small group of trained people who form the basic unit of a military, political, or business organization
But some cadres and scholars known to brief government and party bosses do speak off the record.

grandees
an important person, especially in a particular job or area of public life
Leaders are selectively candid with foreign counterparts, and maintain ties to retired Western grandees.

livid
extremely angry:
It is called a sore loser and a dangerous spoiler, not only unwilling to play a leading role in the world but livid if China becomes more active.

indignation
anger about a situation that you think is wrong or not fair
But it is also a reason for indignation at what is called an American policy of containment.

humbling
The humbling of imperial China by smaller European powers proves that.
