* *verb*, to make something or someone stay in one position by fastening him, her, or it firmly.
* *[example]: Trade can no longer anchor America’s relationship with China*

### motive

* *noun*, a reason for doing something.
* *[example]: Since china emerged from the wreckage of Maoism 40 years ago, the profit motive has become a pillar of stability in its relations with America.*

### queasy

* *adjective*, feeling worried, unhappy, or uncertain about something:
* *[example]: This focus on mutual self-interest involved queasy compromises.*

### discreet

* *adjective*, careful not to cause embarrassment or attract too much attention, especially by keeping something secret:

### thrift

* *adjective*, the careful use of money, especially by avoiding waste
The financial crash of 2008 revealed a dangerous co-dependency between * *[example]: America the importer of cheap goods and China the thrifty exporter. New terms tried to capture this symbiosis: “Chimerica”, or “the g2”.*

### neologisms

* *noun*, a new word or expression, or a new meaning for an existing word.
* *[example]: Rather than catchy neologisms, scholars are reaching for historical analogies.*

### sweep aside

* *[example]: Some talk of 1914, when clashing British and German ambitions swept aside deep bonds of commerce.*

### Thucydides trap

### incumbent

China analysts obsess over the “Thucydides trap” that supposedly dooms upstart nations to fighting incumbent powers, as the Greek historian wrote of Sparta and Athens.

### lopsided
with one side bigger, higher, etc. than the other; not equally balanced.
But it was a lopsided political fight: Japan was a dependent military ally.

### accountable
Western leaders had hoped that joining the global economy would make China more like the West, as a growing middle class demanded free speech and more accountable government.

### populism
The crash of 2008 and spasms of Western populism emboldened Communist Party leaders, notably President Xi Jinping, to reject those norms and assert the party’s supremacy.

### choke
to make someone stop breathing by pressing their throat with the hands

### grave

* seriously bad.
* Define sensitive technologies too broadly and, in the words of Henry Paulson, a former secretary of the treasury, an “economic iron curtain” may come to divide China and America, choking flows of goods, capital, people and technology, with grave implications for the rest of the world.

### prowess
great ability or skill.
China’s growing tech prowess is putting new strains on globalisation, beyond old arguments about stolen jobs.

### political stake
It means that there is more at risk, more danger- the issue has taken a greater importance and could have a greater impact. A stake is the amount of money bet on the outcome of a result, like a horse race, gambling, etc, so if the stakes are higher, there's more to be won or lost.
Today’s supply chains, carrying semiconductors from China to devices in America, actually raise the political stakes.

### quarantine
to put an animal or person in quarantine (a period of time during which an animal or person that might have a disease is kept away from other people or animals so that the disease cannot spread.)

### foe
an enemy.
In this world, trade relations cannot be quarantined from hard questions about whether countries are partners, rivals or foes.

### contention
the disagreement that results from opposing arguments.
It is the relentlessness of its methods that has turned business from a safe space to a field of contention.

### proponent
Few Americans have better access to Chinese leaders than Mr Paulson, a longtime proponent of engagement.

### confrontational
causing or involving angry disagreement:
Bosses do not seek a tariff war, he said, but do want a “more confrontational approach”. Businesses are getting that from the Trump administration.

### occupant
a person who lives or works in a room or building:

### Oval Office
The Oval Office is, since 1909, the working office space of the President of the United States, located in the West Wing of the White House, Washington, D.C.
In part, this is explained by the change in occupant of the Oval Office.

### Belatedly
coming later than expected:

### outpost
a place, especially a small group of buildings or a town, that represents the authority or business interests of a government or company that is far away.
Belatedly, his Pentagon chiefs grew alarmed as China turned disputed reefs in the South China Sea into military outposts. 

### pandemics 
(of a disease) existing in almost all of an area or in almost all of a group of people, animals, or plants.
But ultimately Mr Obama put more weight on tackling global challenges, from climate change to pandemics to nuclear proliferation, for which he needed Chinese help.

### populist
a person, especially a politician, who strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.
In part, America has become more confrontational because multinational businesses that oppose barriers to trade have lost clout in a populist age.

### truce
a short interruption in a war or argument, or an agreement to stop fighting or arguing for a period of time.
A new round of export controls for sensitive technologies and still-tougher investment-screening rules loom. That process will not end with a truce in Mr Trump’s trade war.

### scorn
Voters elected a might-makes-right leader who scorns alliances, who is cynical about the rule of law and universal values and who believes that national interests always come first.

### quizz
to ask someone questions about something.
FBI agents have quizzed scholars visiting from Chinese state-backed think-tanks about government links, and cancelled the visas of some.

### sore 
painful and uncomfortable, esp. (of a body part) because of injury or infection or (of a muscle) from being used too much:
Meanwhile, officials in Beijing see a sore loser of a superpower, bent on keeping them down.

### ploy
something that is done or said in order to get an advantage, often dishonestly:
They scoff at the idea that rich, spoiled America really feels threatened, seeing a ploy to extract better terms for American firms to make money

### miss
This misses how many people in Washington believe that the China threat is real and matters more than profits or free-market purity.

### emphatic
done or said in a strong way and without any doubt.
A senior American official says that China “emphatically” lied when it promised Mr Obama in 2015 that state-backed actors would stop spying on America for commercial gain.

### lament
to express sadness and feeling sorry about something:

### frenzied
uncontrolled and excited, sometimes violent:
The official laments that, in the frenzied Washington news cycle, few noticed a Department of Justice indictment in December 2018 accusing China’s ministry of state security of ties to a long-standing campaign by the APT10 hacking group, stealing secrets from firms in aviation, space, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, maritime and other technologies.

### snigger
to laugh at someone or something in a silly and often unkind way.
The pendulum risks swinging too far. Some sniggered in March when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (cfius), a government agency that screens foreign deals for security concerns, asked a Chinese internet firm to sell Grindr, a gay dating app with 3.3m daily users.

### “forward presence” doctrine
Since the 1980s America has pursued a “forward presence” doctrine, meaning that its forces were confident about operating close to enemy defences. China’s growing strength confronts Pentagon planners with their hardest decision in years: to find new ways to make combat in the Western Pacific viable, or pull back and force adversaries to fight far from home.

### grapple
to fight, especially in order to win something:
Now at Stanford University, he describes commanders grappling with the end of overwhelming American superiority: “There is an intense debate within the American armed forces about how to counter the PLA’s accelerating efforts to control the South China Sea.”

## [In Washington, talk of a China threat cuts across the political divide](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/05/18/in-washington-talk-of-a-china-threat-cuts-across-the-political-divide)

### cut across
to include within the scope of effect or significance
In Washington, talk of a China threat cuts across the political divide

### annexe
an extra building added to a larger building:

### pomp
showy, formal ceremony, esp. on public occasions.
Amid the high-ceilinged pomp of the Indian Treaty Room, the executives signed one-day non-disclosure agreements allowing them to see classified material.

### afoot
happening or being planned or prepared:
Recent arrests of alleged Chinese spies reveal only a small fraction of what is afoot, Mr Rubio says.

### vow
to make a determined decision or promise to do something.
Too often politicians would vow to get tough on Chinese cheating.

### deputised
to act or speak for another person, especially at work.
Then these CEOs would be deputised by China to march down to the White House.

### venture capitalist
A venture capitalist (VC) is an investor that provides capital to firms exhibiting high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake.

### grumble
to complain about someone or something in an annoyed way:
Mr Rubio grumbles that the business plan of some Silicon Valley tech firms is to get bought up, without necessarily caring if the investors are Chinese.

### remit

The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act recently extended the remit of CFIUS to new areas, such as property purchases near sensitive sites.

### pilot
A pilot plan, product, or system is used to test how good something is before introducing it:

### mandate
to give official permission for something to happen, to order someone to do something.
A pilot scheme mandates reviews of foreign stakes in a wide array of “critical technologies”.

### bipartisan
supported by or consisting of two political parties.
The staging of that October road show—a bipartisan endeavour involving Congress and the intelligence agencies, close to the White House but not inside it—is revealing.

### stand apart
Mr Trump stands apart.

### Discern
to see, recognize, or understand something that is not clear:
Discerning a united view of China within Team Trump is hard.

### trample
to step heavily on something or someone, causing damage or injury.

### nicety
a detail or small difference that is only obvious after careful thought. The fact that something is based on very slight differences
That tone is a sign of their boss’s willingness to trample diplomatic niceties.

### climb down
to descend, especially by using both hands and feet. to retreat, as from an indefensible opinion or position:
He also sees political risks in any trade deal that can be branded a climb-down.

### telling
with a striking or revealing effect; significantly.
Tellingly Mr Trump’s China tariff escalation on May 10th was accompanied by defensive tweets asserting that China yearns for a “very weak” Democrat to win the 2020 election instead.

### predate
to have existed or happened before another thing:

### outlast
to live or exist, or to stay energetic and determined, longer than another person or thing:
Modern-day Chinese mandarins obsess over differences within the Trump administration, not realising that the hardening of the Washington mood predates and will outlast Mr Trump.

### gander
a look or glance.
Taking a proper gander

### sabotage
A study commissioned by the Pentagon, “Deliver Uncompromised”, warns that insecure supply chains place America’s armed forces at “grave risk” from hacking and high-tech sabotage, for instance by the insertion of malware or components designed to fail in combat.

### provenance
the beginning of something's existence; something's origin.
The study, by Mitre, a research outfit, notes that modern fighter jets may rely on 10m lines of software code, so it matters if tech firms use code of unknown provenance, as some do.

### scour
to search a place or thing very carefully in order to try to find something.
Pentagon chiefs have created a new Office of Commercial and Economic Analysis whose mission includes scouring defence contracts for Chinese companies, down to third-tier suppliers.

### foundry
He already sees more high-value defence contracts going to semiconductor foundries in America.

### containment strategy
Containment was a United States policy using numerous strategies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to enlarge its communist sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam.
On April 29th the State Department’s director of policy planning, Kiron Skinner, told a forum hosted by New America, a Washington think-tank, that there was a need for a China strategy equivalent to George Kennan’s containment strategy for the Soviet Union.

### bombshell

an overwhelming surprise or disappointment.
Not content with that bombshell, Ms Skinner ventured that China is a harder problem.

### ahistoricism
Leaving aside the ahistoricism of Ms Skinner’s comments—for China’s Communists drew deeply on Marx and Lenin—they are self-defeating.

### revisionist
someone who examines and tries to change existing beliefs about how events happened or what their importance or meaning is:
China is selectively revisionist, wrote Mr Feigenbaum. Rather than seeking to replace today’s international system, it upholds many of the “forms” of multilateralism while undermining “norms” from within the UN and other bodies.

### The Capitol
the building in which the US Congress meets
In a break between votes, in a windowless office deep in the Capitol, Mr Coons urges Congress to try the hard work of dealing with China as it is and not as America wishes it to be.

### concede
to admit, often unwillingly, that something is true:

### dovish
supporting discussion or other peaceful solutions in political relationships rather than the use of force:
He does not think China is hostile to the idea of a rules-based order, but concedes that it has “behaved exceptionally badly on the world economic stage”. In today’s Washington, that is dovish talk.

## [In Beijing, views of America have become deeply cynical](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/05/18/in-beijing-views-of-america-have-become-deeply-cynical)

### lingering
lasting a long time:

### harbours 
to protect someone or something bad, especially by hiding that person or thing when the police are looking for him, her, or it:
Marriage metaphors capture the lingering admiration mixed with envy and resentment that China’s elite harbours for its global rival.

### cadres
a small group of trained people who form the basic unit of a military, political, or business organization
But some cadres and scholars known to brief government and party bosses do speak off the record.

### grandee
an important person, especially in a particular job or area of public life

### candid
truthful and honest
Leaders are selectively candid with foreign counterparts, and maintain ties to retired Western grandees.

### livid
extremely angry:
It is called a sore loser and a dangerous spoiler, not only unwilling to play a leading role in the world but livid if China becomes more active.

### indignation
anger about a situation that you think is wrong or not fair
But it is also a reason for indignation at what is called an American policy of containment.

### humbling
The humbling of imperial China by smaller European powers proves that.

### cynical
believing that people are only interested in themselves and are not sincere:
Depressingly, the argument that follows is a cynical one about the relative strengths of China, America and Canada.

### sidestepping
to step to the side in order to avoid something, especially being hit:
It is rarely about the details of the legal case against Ms Meng, arrested at the request of American prosecutors, who accuse her of sidestepping sanctions against Iran.

### ensue
to happen after something else, esp. as a result of it:
Pro-China protests have ensued in Canada and Hong Kong (pictured).

### impertinence
rude and not showing respect, especially towards someone older or in a higher position than you:
But in private, when officials protest about America’s insistence on sending warships and planes through those disputed waters, the complaint is that America is showing disrespect, and would never tolerate such impertinence in its own backyard.

### barons
an extremely powerful person in a particular area of business:
In meetings with central-government leaders, Western bosses would talk up their positive experiences, both out of caution and because they saw little point in raising problems caused by powerful provincial and local barons, knowing that the central government might simply ask those barons to investigate themselves.

### mum
to say nothing about a subject:
Having stayed mum in China, American businesses would grumble to their own government, which would take their complaints to the Chinese. 

### gloat
to feel or express great pleasure or satisfaction because of your own success or good luck, or someone else's failure or bad luck:
Another generation of high-flying, middle-aged officials is more inclined to gloat.

### sniff
to smell something by taking air in through your nose:
Mr Trump’s diagnosis of America’s ills is quite correct, they sniff.

### meritocratic
relating to a meritocracy (= a social system in which people's success or power is related to their abilities):

### pragmatic
solving problems in a sensible way that suits the conditions that really exist now, rather than obeying fixed theories, ideas, or rules:
The most candid voices admit that China got Mr Trump wrong, at first thinking him a pragmatic New York businessman in the mould of others they have known.

### bluster
talk intended to seem important or threatening but which is not taken seriously and has little effect:

### theatre
behaviour that is not sincere and is intended just to produce a particular effect or to attract attention:
Mr Trump’s escalation of the trade fight shocked Chinese leaders, who assured visiting Western leaders in spring 2018 that his bluster was theatre, and that both sides had too much to lose for a real trade war to start.

### pugnacious
wanting to start an argument or fight, or expressing an argument or opinion very forcefully:
This involved reformist Chinese scholars discreetly welcoming Mr Trump’s pugnacious ways.

### statist
supporting or based on the principle of statism(the principle that the government should own or control most of a country's industry and economy)
Some call him a statist who does not understand economics. 

### rhetoric
speech or writing intended to be effective and influence people.

### backlash
a strong and adverse reaction by a large number of people, especially to a social or political development.

### bungle
to do something wrong, in a careless or stupid way
Others blame his assertive rhetoric about China’s rise for a backlash abroad, and say he has bungled the American trade war.

### deplore 
to say or think that something is very bad:
The puzzle is to know whether such Beijing grumblers matter more or less than the American establishment grandees who deplore Mr Trump at dinner parties in Washington, DC.

### grip

* *verb*, to hold very tightly.
* *[example]: Bonnie Glaser, a well-connected China specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think-tank, recently reported that the upper ranks of the People’s Liberation Army are gripped by fear, amid a sense that an anti-corruption drive ordered by Mr Xi has gone too far.*

### exasperate
to make someone very annoyed, usually when they can do nothing to solve a problem
Mr Xi has told foreign visitors that he is exasperated by American inconstancy.

### accord
(a formal) agreement:
He also pointed out that Mr Obama had persuaded him to join the Paris accord on climate change, only for Mr Trump to pull America out.

### enmity
a feeling of hate.
Chinese officials still go out of their way to note that America is a much stronger and richer country whose enmity they do not seek.

### duly
in the correct way or at the correct time; as expected:

China has duly showered Iowa with demonstrations of amity.

### convertible
a car with a soft roof that can be folded back.
Sarah Lande (pictured) helped to organise Mr Xi’s visit in 1985, giving him a lift in her red convertible (she regrets declining his request to drive it).

### broadbrush
lacking in detail and subtlety.
If a young Chinese official were to visit today, she is not sure his delegation would get the same sort of welcome: “What we show them might be a bit broad-brush now.”

### outlandish
strange and unusual and difficult to accept or like:
At roughly the same time 363,000 students from China were hosted by American colleges and schools. Those numbers make talk of a cold war seems outlandish.

### guardrails
a bar along the edge of something steep, such as stairs or a cliff, to prevent people from falling off
Beyond trade, people-to-people exchanges look like sturdy guardrails to keep relations on track.

### Alas

* *adverb*, used to express sadness or feeling sorry about something.
Alas, those guardrails are weaker than they may appear.

### leaflet
a piece of paper that gives you information or advertises something.
