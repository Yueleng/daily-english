### the half of it

* the most important part or aspect of something.
* *[example]: Fighting over trade is not the half of it.*

### blockbuster films

* A blockbuster is a Hollywood movie that's made with a large budget and big stars. A true blockbuster is extremely popular and brings in a lot of money. Typically, a blockbuster is a fabulous summer movie that audiences line up to see the first weekend it's released.
* *[example]: The United States and China are contesting every domain, from semiconductors to submarines and from blockbuster films to lunar exploration.*

### lot

* *noun*, an amount or set of things, especially when there are several of these amounts.
* *[example]: The two superpowers used to seek a win-win world. Today winning seems to involve the other lot’s defeat—a collapse that permanently subordinates China to the American order; or a humbled America that retreats from the western Pacific.*

### sour

* *verb*, make or become sour, having a sharp, sometimes unpleasant, taste or smell, like a lemon, and not sweet.
* *[example]: As our special report in this week’s issue explains, superpower relations have soured.*

### fester

* *verb* If an argument or bad feeling festers, it continues so that feelings of hate or lack of satisfaction increase.
* *[example]: Even if China and America stop short of conflict, the world will bear the cost as growth slows and problems are left to fester for lack of co-operation.*

### crack

* *verb*, to find a solution to a problem.
* *[example]: No law of physics says that quantum computing, artificial intelligence and other technologies must be cracked by scientists who are free to vote.*

### brittle

* *[example]: Given that migrants are vital to innovation, the Trump administration’s hurdles to legal immigration are self-defeating.*

### denigration

### rubbish

* *verb*, to criticize something.

### buttress

### shore up something

* *verb*, to make something stronger by supporting it.
* *[example]: As well as focusing on its strengths, America needs to shore up its defences.*

### novel

* *noun*, new and original, not like anything seen before.
* *[example]: This involves hard power as China arms itself, including in novel domains such as space and cyberspace.*

### strike a balance

* If you strike a balance between two things, you accept parts of both things in order to satisfy some of the demands of both sides in an argument, rather than all the demands of just one side:
* *[example] But it also means striking a balance between protecting intellectual property and sustaining the flow of ideas, people, capital and goods.*

### scoff

* *verb*, to laugh and talk about a person or idea in a way that shows that you think they are stupid or silly.

### disingenuous

* (of a person or their behaviour) slightly dishonest, or not speaking the complete truth

## [Donald Trump gets tough on Huawei](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/05/16/donald-trump-gets-tough-on-huawei?cid1=cust/dailypicks/n/bl/n/20190516n/owned/n/n/dailypicks/n/n/NA/241153/n)

ensnare
to catch or get control of something or someone
Two decisions could ensnare other Chinese technology firms

mooted
to suggest something for discussion.

spooks 
a spy
SOME MAY have wondered why it took so long. An American prohibition against the use of equipment made by Huawei had long been mooted, out of fear that China’s spooks could use it to spy on its geopolitical rival.

renounce
to say formally or publicly that you no longer own, support, believe in, or have a connection with something:
Big American mobile operators have already renounced the use of its gear for their fifth-generation (5G) networks.

browbeat
to try to force someone to do something by threatening them or persuading them forcefully and unfairly:

forswearing
to make a serious decision to stop doing something.
The administration of Donald Trump has attempted to browbeat Western allies into forswearing Huawei too; imposing a ban of its own was expected to help with the cajoling.

woolly
Woolly ideas and thinking are confused and not clear, and have not been considered carefully enough.
Some of the ban’s woolliest bits—who counts as a foreign adversary, for instance—should be clarified with the help of American spies within the next 150 days

interdiction
the act of stopping something or of not allowing something, or an occasion when this happens
Samm Sacks of New America, a think-tank in Washington, DC, says that this direct interdiction is “a complete shock”.

blanket ban/rule/statement
a statement, rule etc that affects everyone or includes all possible cases
Those who doubt, for now, that a blanket American ban is inevitable say its intent is to make Huawei’s kit look like a less dependable option to service providers elsewhere.

stockpile
to store a large supply of something for future use.
Reports emerged earlier this year of international telecoms carriers stockpiling equipment, as fears of an American ban grew.

crippling
causing serious injuries or harm:
When ZTE was banned in April 2018, the effect was crippling.

reprieve
an official order that stops or delays the punishment, especially by death, of a prisoner:
In barely three months the ban brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy, before it earned a reprieve from Mr Trump, after a personal appeal from China’s president, Xi Jinping.

flirt with
To come very close to some outcome or result, often (though not always) a very bad one.
Few observers expect Huawei to flirt with bankruptcy in the way ZTE has.

sway
to persuade someone to believe or do one thing rather than another.
Although its HiSilicon unit designs some of its chips in-house, the company outsources their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, a giant chipmaker, which could be swayed by the Americans.

bargaining chip
a potential concession or other factor which can be used to advantage in negotiations.
Coming amid an intensifying trade war between America and China—and given the ZTE precedent—the ban on Huawei may also be a bargaining chip in talks.

recalcitrant
(of a person) unwilling to obey orders or to do what should be done, or (of an animal) refusing to be controlled.
At a minimum, it will be used as one with recalcitrant European allies.

hash out something
to talk about something with someone else in order to reach agreement about it.
But as officials hash out the scope of Mr Trump’s executive order, more than just the usual suspects could find themselves ensnared.

discretionary
available to someone by choice, without having to get permission or authority.
Ms Sacks says that it could become a “discretionary tool” for America to use against Chinese companies as it sees fit—including against perceived risks to the country’s entire digital infrastructure.

## [Xi Jinping decides to abolish presidential term limits](https://www.economist.com/china/2018/03/01/xi-jinping-decides-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits)

palpable
so obvious that it can easily be seen or known, or (of a feeling) so strong that it seems as if it can be touched or physically felt:
Unhappiness in China is palpable

ingenuity
the skill of thinking, performing, or using things in new ways, esp. to solve problems:
Bloggers in China surpassed themselves in their ingenuity after the Communist Party announced its plan to get rid of presidential term limits, which would have required Xi Jinping to step down as head of state in 2023.

portly
(especially of middle-aged or old men) fat and round:
The Bear of Very Little Brain is used in China as code for the portly Mr Xi—the post was swiftly deleted by humourless censors.

solemnly
serious and without any humour.
The manufacturer solemnly informed readers that these were fakes.

warlord
a military leader who controls a country or, more often, an area within a country
“Yuan Shikai”, an early 20th-century warlord who declared himself emperor and died six months later.

dissent
a strong difference of opinion on a particular subject, especially about an official suggestion or plan or a popular belief:
There was also some unusual open dissent. 

scrape
to remove an unwanted covering or a top layer from something, especially using a sharp edge or something rough:
Many Chinese, it seems, regard scrapping term limits as a return to the bad old days of strongman rule.

rubber-stamp
a small device with raised letters made of rubber, used for printing the date, name of an organization, etc. on documents
to officially approve a decision or plan without thinking about it:
Such limits may not matter much in themselves (they will be formally abolished at an annual session of the rubber-stamp parliament, which starts on March 5th).

pierce
to go into or through something, making a hole in it using a sharp point:
It also pierces the veil of politics and shows what kind of ruler he wants to be.

opaque
preventing light from travelling through, and therefore not transparent or translucent.

treacherous
If the ground or sea is treacherous, it is extremely dangerous, especially because of bad weather conditions:
At a time when he is trying to boost China’s image globally as a modern, outward-looking and responsible state, the political system he governs seems premodern, opaque and treacherous.


the Politburo
the main government group in a Communist country, which makes all the important decisions


inner sanctum
a private place or room where someone is never interrupted
In China, they are not even in the top 25. Neither man is a member of the Politburo, let alone its inner sanctum, the Politburo Standing Committee.

Leninist
someone who believes in the social, political, and economic principles and theories developed from Marxism by the Russian politician V. I. Lenin, supporting direct rule by workers:

bedevil
to confuse, annoy, or cause problems or difficulties for someone or something:
As with other Leninist systems, it is bedevilled by the problem of leadership succession.

precedent
the way that something has been done in the past that therefore shows that it is the correct way.
In the 1980s, reacting to the chaos of the Mao era, Deng Xiaoping tried to make the system more orderly and predictable by introducing new rules, norms and precedents.


reinstitute
to institute (something) again
These included the reinstitution of the post of president (there had not been one since 1968), along with a two-term limit for the holder of that office as well as the vice-president.

rein
to control or direct with or as if with reins
As the abolition of term limits shows, he failed—or at least, his reforms failed to rein in Mr Xi.

cast aside
Now he has cast aside Deng’s efforts to introduce a system of succession by timetable.

anti-graft
opposed to or designed to reduce corruption.

rid
Mr Xi has used his anti-graft campaign to rid himself of other rivals—most recently Sun Zhengcai, who was party chief of the south-western region of Chongqing, the same job that Mr Bo had held.


murky
The events leading up to the removal of term limits show how murky politics remains.

odd
somewhat more than the indicated approximate quantity, extent, or degree —usually used in combination
The proposal came from the party’s Central Committee, comprising its most senior 200-odd officials.

communique
an official piece of news or an announcement, especially to the public or newspapers:
That meeting produced a communiqué about constitutional reform, which did not mention that term limits had been discussed.

heads roll
heads will roll. Someone will be severely punished, as in If no one meets the chairman's plane, heads will roll. This hyperbolic expression alludes to the punishment of being beheaded.
So last weekend’s news that they would be abolished was a complete surprise. Curiously, it was revealed by the English-language service of Xinhua, the government’s main news-agency, hours before it was released in Chinese (heads rolled at Xinhua because of this).

draconian
Draconian laws, government actions, etc. are extremely severe, or go further than what is right or necessary:
Mr Xi’s constitutional changes—which go beyond scrapping term limits—could make the political system even more opaque and draconian.

preamble
an introduction to a speech or piece of writing
The current constitution mentions the leading role of the party only in its preamble.

amalgamate
to join or unite to form a larger organization or group, or to make separate organizations do this.
Party and state could hardly become more amalgamated.

judiciary
the part of a country's government that is responsible for its legal system, including all the judges in the country's courts:
No less important, the parliament will approve what looks like a new administrative branch that merges elements of the party, government, police and judiciary into a powerful organisation called the National Supervision Commission.

turn one's back one
to ignore someone or something
For years scholars like him have been trying, as Deng did, to devise ways of reconciling constitutional norms with one-party rule. They fear that Mr Xi has turned his back on this effort.

in any dispute

So why has he done this? He could have stayed on as general secretary. His ideology, called “Xi Jinping Thought for a New Era”, would still have been in the party’s own charter, giving him the status of final arbiter in any dispute.
get to grips

grip
control over something or someone:

entrenched
Entrenched ideas are so fixed or have existed for so long that they cannot be changed:
It is even possible, as People’s Daily argued online on February 26th, that staying as president and party chief for another ten years or more will lead to more consistent, long-term policy-making and perhaps enable him to get to grips with some of the economy’s entrenched problems.

blunder
a serious mistake, usually caused by not taking care or thinking.
The abolition of term limits may be just such a blunder.
