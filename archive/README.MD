# Daily English

This repository is used for people who wants to constantly improve his or her English level through reading articles.

This repository intended to have 10 chapters. Every chapter inculdes 10 `.md` files. Every `.md` files includes several articles and the words with explanations.

Articles are chosen from [Toronto Life](https://torontolife.com), [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com), and mostly often, [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/).

For every article, We have listed the words that need explanations. We also gave the centence where the word appear. It is possible that one centence has more than one word to be explained, and thus we listed those words together while only list the centence once(in the last word).

We try to give only original forms of the words.
